have created a quiz program which goes through 5 questions. If you get a question wrong you are forced to start again from the beginning, I added this loop by placing the code goto start; and placed start: where I wanted it to loop from.

My question is: I want to add a part at the end where it says how many times the program was looped so I can add a writeline saying "well done you took X times to complete the quiz"

here is the main part of the program:(without the namespaces and using statements)

        /*----------------------------------------Declaration----------------------------------------- */

        string q1, q2, q3, q4, q5;

        /*----------------------------------------TITLE----------------------------------------- */

        Console.WriteLine("Welcome to the Ultimate quiz!");
        Console.WriteLine();

        /*----------------------------------------QUESTION 1----------------------------------------- */
        start:
        Console.WriteLine("The JavaScript Language is not object oriented (True/False)");
        Console.WriteLine();
        q1 = Console.ReadLine();
        q1 = q1.ToUpper();

        if (q1 == "TRUE")
        {
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine("Well Done, you may move on to the next question");
        }

        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Sorry you got the answer wrong, you have to start again");
            goto start;
        }

        Console.WriteLine();

        /*----------------------------------------QUESTION 2----------------------------------------- */

        Console.WriteLine("What is the age range to qualify for an apprenticeship in the uk? Please type in the following format xx-yy");
        Console.WriteLine();
        q2 = Console.ReadLine();

        if (q2 == "16-24")
        {
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine("Well Done, you may move on to the next question");
        }

        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Sorry you got the answer wrong, you have to start again");
            goto start;
        }

        Console.WriteLine();

        /*----------------------------------------QUESTION 3----------------------------------------- */

        Console.WriteLine("Is HTML a programming language (Yes or No)");
        Console.WriteLine();
        q3 = Console.ReadLine();
        q3 = q3.ToUpper();

        if (q3 == "NO")
        {
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine("Well Done, you may move on to the next question");
        }

        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Sorry you got the answer wrong, you have to start again");
            goto start;
        }

        Console.WriteLine();

        /*----------------------------------------QUESTION 4----------------------------------------- */
        Console.WriteLine("In JavaScript, What are the 2 charecters used to symbolise a single line comment?");
        Console.WriteLine();
        q4 = Console.ReadLine();

        if (q4 == "//")
        {
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine("Well Done, you may move on to the next question");
        }

        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Sorry you got the answer wrong, you have to start again");
            goto start;
        }

        Console.WriteLine();

        /*----------------------------------------QUESTION 5----------------------------------------- */
        Console.WriteLine("500 < 600 && 700 < 600");
        Console.WriteLine();
        Console.WriteLine("Is the above statement true or false ?");
        Console.WriteLine();
        q5 = Console.ReadLine();
        q5 = q5.ToUpper();

        if (q5 == "FALSE")
        {
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine("Well Done, you may move on to the next question");
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine("Congratulations You have passed the quiz!");
        }

        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Sorry you got the answer wrong, you have to start again");
            goto start;
        }

        Console.WriteLine();


        }
    }
}
Thanks for all the help.

Is there a reason why you are using goto? –

I am an apprentice and learning c#. i saw a video on YouTube using this loop but I was advised by my boss that its quite old code and I should organise it into methods to wrap them haven't got that far yet –

You might find it easier if you find a different learning tool. goto can make you code hard to follow. –

Simply add three line in your code -->

Before Start: --> int count = 0;
After Start: --> count++;
Last line of your code. -->
